  This is a CLI app that uses inquirer prompts to gather information on a team of employees. The application renders an output html that shows the information in individualized employee cards for each employee. The cards will have clickable links to see the employees email and github page. The application also uses jest to test the functionality and ensure everything is working properly.
  ## Installation
  To run this app, the user needs to install node.js, and inquirer
  ## Usage
  the app is used by opening up the command line in the 'develop' directory and typing 'node app.js'. The user answers the prompt questions to enter information for each employee. Upon completion the console will log 'team built!' and at that point the user will click on the team.html file in the output folder and open it in the browser to view their team.
